# Implicit Neural Representation of Images

This repo aims to create neural representations of multiple images.
Part of the code is based on 'Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions' .
It has been modified in order to handle represntation of two images.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661

implementation of the paper: https://github.com/vsitzmann/siren

## How to run

The code has been tested on Python 3.6, using PyTorch 1.6.0 and Torchvision 0.7.0 .

The network is implemented in the `network.py` file and all data related functions are in `data_processor.py`.
The experiments and analysis are in the notebook.
